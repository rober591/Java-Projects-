A REST server  app to play Òguess the number Ògame known as "Bulls and Cows".This application uses Spring Boot REST  with JDBC Template to access the database.A Game should have an answer and a status (in progress or finished). While the game is in progress, users should not be able to see the answer. The answer will be a 4-digit number with no duplicate digits.Each Round will have a guess, the time of the guess, and the result of the guess in the format "e:0:p:0" where "e" stands for exact matches and "p" stands for partial matches.Description:In each game, a 4-digit number is generated where every digit is different. For each round, the user guesses a number and is told the exact and partial digit matches.* An exact match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit in the correct position.* A partial match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit but in the wrong position.Once the number is guessed (exact matches for all digits) the user wins the game.Use Postman.com to play the game online.
